#Conway's game of Life 
The principles of this game were created in 1970 by mathematician John Conway.

### How to use.
- Run - make all universe change
- Pause - just freeze, you can unfreeze it by clicking run button
- Stop - clear all and stop game
- Buttons for changin speed could be use while game in running
- random - get random universe, could be applyed just for stopped/paused game. Minimun speed 100 ms.
- add/remove cells - field of Universe could be modifyed by clicking on targeting cell. Worked while running, but due to
high speed not so comfortable, so better use 'pause'

### What will be added soon. At least I'm thinking about it. 
1. Brush painting for live cells
2. Torus mode for universe
3. State for buttons.
4. Random with percentages.
